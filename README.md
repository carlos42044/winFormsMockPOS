# WinForms POS (Point of Sales System)
A simple mock POS system designed for testing purposes. This system was built using WinForms (c#) in visual studio. The main purpose for this project was learning. This project was an excellent way to learn C# and using the Visual Studio 2017 IDE. This POS system allows a user to select from a list 'employee users' with the ability to change how transactions are processed, either in-window or via popup window.
